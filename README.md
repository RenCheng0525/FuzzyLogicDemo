## Overview
An interactive web-based fuzzy logic visualization tool that allows users to explore fuzzy sets, inference systems, and defuzzification methods. Built with **D3.js**, this application provides an intuitive way to understand the mathematical foundations of fuzzy logic.

## Features

### Fuzzy Sets and Operations
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Graphical representation of fuzzy membership functions.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust membership function parameters interactively.
- **Supported Functions**: Triangular, Trapezoidal, Gaussian, Sigmoid, and Bell-shaped functions.
- **Fuzzy Operations**: Intersection (AND), Union (OR), Complement (NOT), Algebraic Sum/Product.

### Fuzzy Inference System
- **Rule-Based Inference**: Define fuzzy rules using an interactive interface.
- **Real-Time Fuzzification**: Converts crisp inputs into fuzzy membership values.
- **Inference Engine**: Uses Mamdani-style fuzzy inference with rule aggregation.
- **Defuzzification Methods**: Centroid, Bisector, Mean of Maximum (MOM), First of Maximum (FOM), Last of Maximum (LOM).

### Interactive Controls
- **Parameter Sliders**: Adjust input values dynamically and observe changes.
- **Rule Management**: Add, modify, and tune fuzzy rules with intuitive UI.
- **Progress Visualization**: Displays historical defuzzification results as a trend chart.

## Technical Highlights
- **Built with D3.js**: Enables smooth SVG-based chart rendering.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports flexible rule modifications and extensions.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile browsers.
- **Real-Time Computation**: Performs fuzzy logic operations and defuzzification instantly.

## Use Cases
- **Educational Tool**: Helps students and researchers understand fuzzy logic concepts.
- **Decision Support**: Demonstrates how fuzzy logic can be used for intelligent decision-making.
- **Control Systems**: Showcases applications like temperature control and automation.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Illustrates how fuzzy logic applies to data clustering and AI.

## Browser Support
- Works on all modern browsers with JavaScript and SVG support.
